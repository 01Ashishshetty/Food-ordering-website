            Our pan pizza is loved for its soft, chewy crust and perfect blend of tomato sauce and mozzarella-cheddar cheese. 
            For a lighter bite, try our thin, airy Italian crust. 
            We also offer a variety of unique sauces like spicy buffalo, sweet BBQ, tangy chipotle, and creamy makhni, 
            giving you the freedom to customize your pizza.
